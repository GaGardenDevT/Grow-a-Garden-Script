# Grow a Garden Script - Auto Farm, Infinite Seeds, Sell All

![Grow a Garden Script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d371ad4-1983-4b2a-8962-5cff1229d646)

The `Grow a Garden Script` is written in **Lua**, the scripting language used by Roblox. It is designed to interact with the game‚Äôs objects and events to automate common player actions. The script dynamically detects game elements like seeds, crops, tools, and shop interfaces, and then executes the right action based on the current state of the farm.
The script is structured for ease of editing, so developers can customize specific parts‚Äîsuch as farming frequency, targeted crops, or tool usage logic‚Äîdepending on their needs.
